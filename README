RATEMYDININGHALL
================================================================================
Created by: <Ratemydininghall> (<Jasmine Schaber, Sophie Zhou>)
Presented at JumboHack 2025 under the General track.

Inspired by ratemyprofessor, ratemydininghall is a website where students can
rate their meals at their school's dining hall each day! Right now, the website
is personalized to Tufts students, where they can select Dewick or Carm on the 
homepage. Each page shows the dining hall's overall average rating, their
daily rating, and rating per meal period. The page is refreshed every day,
and students like, dislike, and save other people's posts. Similar to Beli,
students can make a post with a personal rating, upload images, and write 
comments. Users can also see their past posts, their top posts, as well as 
their saved posts.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Thank you to WMCC and A2 Empowerment, our jumbocode groups for giving us a 
great foundation for our code!! Also thanks to ChatGPT and stackoverflow.

REFLECTION
We we thinking of what students need on this campus, and we realized a big 
debate for us is always whether to eat at Carm or Dewick. A common issue is 
that the menu is often misleading, and once you get to the dining hall, you
realize the food is actaully horrible and you were gaslighted by the menu.
Or, even worse, you decide to go to Dewick on a day where Carm has berries.
So, we thought that it would useful to have a "ratemyprofessor" like website,
where students can help each other out!

We would definitely like to expand this website to other schools, and include
more features such as a user leaderboard "dining legend status", and expanding 
it to kindelvan, hodge, etc. 

This is our first hackathon, and it was just the two of us doing the code, so 
it was honestly super super challenging. We also just learned web dev this year
so it was a huge learning curve at the beginning where we tried to set up the
basics. Also, we basically have no experience doing the backend of any of this
so yeah.. stressful times :)

We had a teammate drop out.. so yeah!
